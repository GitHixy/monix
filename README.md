## üõ°Ô∏è Adding Monix to Windows Defender Exclusions

If Windows Defender flags Monix as a potential threat, you can add it to the exclusions list to prevent it from being mistakenly removed.
This is caused because Monix can create a key in your registry that will allow the app to run on Windows Startup and that is a common case of false positive.

### Steps to Add Monix to Windows Defender Exclusions:

1. Open **Windows Security**:
   - Press `Win + S` and search for **Windows Security**.
   - Click on **Virus & Threat Protection**.

2. Scroll down to **Virus & Threat Protection Settings** and click **Manage Settings**.

3. Scroll to the bottom and click **Add or Remove Exclusions** under **Exclusions**.

4. Click **Add an Exclusion** and choose **File**.

5. Browse to the location of the Monix executable:
   - For example: `C:\Path\To\Monix.exe`.

6. Select the file and confirm.

Monix should now run without being flagged or removed by Windows Defender. If you encounter any issues, please let us know!
